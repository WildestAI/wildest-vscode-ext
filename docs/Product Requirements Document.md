## **Product Requirements Document: Semantic Diff VSCode Extension**

### **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a VSCode extension that enhances the standard file comparison (diff) experience by providing a **semantic understanding of code changes**, rather than just line-by-line textual differences. The goal is to make code reviews and change comprehension more efficient and intuitive for developers.

### **2. Goals**

* **Improve Code Review Efficiency:** Enable developers to quickly grasp the *intent* behind changes, not just the raw line additions/deletions.
* **Enhance Change Comprehension:** Provide a visually distinct and semantically richer representation of code modifications.
* **Reduce Cognitive Load:** Minimize the effort required to interpret complex diffs, especially for refactoring or structural changes.

### **3. Key Features**

* **Custom Diff View:** Present a dedicated, custom UI for displaying diffs, distinct from VSCode's built-in diff editor. This will leverage **Webviews** for maximum UI flexibility.
* **Semantic Change Detection:**
    * Identify and highlight changes based on code structure (e.g., function signature changes, parameter reordering, class member additions/removals).
    * Distinguish between purely formatting changes and actual code logic changes.
    * (Future consideration: Support for specific languages, starting with JavaScript/TypeScript).
* **Enhanced Visualizations:**
    * Use distinct colors, icons, or visual cues to represent different types of semantic changes.
    * Potentially allow for folding/unfolding of unchanged code blocks to focus on relevant modifications.
    * (Future consideration: Inline highlighting of intra-line changes based on semantic parsing).
* **User-Triggered Activation:** A dedicated VSCode command (e.g., "Show Semantic Diff") will be available to initiate the custom diff view, either by selecting two files or by analyzing an already open built-in diff.

### **4. Non-Goals**

* Replacing VSCode's default diff functionality entirely.
* Directly modifying the rendering of the built-in diff editor (decorations may be explored as a minor enhancement, but the core experience will be a custom view).
* Comprehensive semantic analysis for all programming languages in the initial release.

### **5. Technical Considerations**

* **Extension Type:** VSCode Extension (TypeScript).
* **Bundler:** **esbuild** for fast compilation and efficient extension packaging.
* **Semantic Analysis:** Utilize external libraries or custom parsing logic to understand code structure and detect semantic differences.
