# Product Status: LLM-Powered DiffGraph VSCode Extension

## Phase 1: Foundation & CLI Integration

1. **Project Setup & Basic Extension**
   - ✅ Completed: VSCode extension project initialized with TypeScript and esbuild. Basic scripts set up. Extension compiles and activates.

2. **Command Registration**
   - ✅ Completed: `diffGraph.generate` command registered in `extension.ts` and added to `package.json`. Command appears in the Command Palette and shows an information message when executed.

3. **Basic Webview Panel Creation**
   - ✅ Completed: The command handler now creates and shows a `vscode.WebviewPanel` with a placeholder HTML content ("<h1>Generating DiffGraph...</h1>").

4. **Obtain Raw Git Diff Content (for a Changeset)**
   - ⬜ Not Started: No code to access Git extension or retrieve/log raw diff output.

5. **Execute External DiffGraph CLI Tool**
   - ⬜ Not Started: No integration with `diffgraph-cli` or dummy CLI script.

6. **Load Generated HTML into Webview**
   - ⬜ Not Started: No logic to load HTML output from CLI into a Webview.

## Summary
- **Current Progress:** Steps 1, 2, and 3 of Phase 1 are complete (project setup, scripts, build system, command registration, and WebviewPanel creation).
- **Next Step:** Implement logic to obtain raw Git diff content for a changeset.

_This status is based on the Product Roadmap as of 27 May 2025._
