# Product Status: LLM-Powered DiffGraph VSCode Extension

## Phase 1: Foundation & CLI Integration

1. **Project Setup & Basic Extension**
   - ✅ Completed: VSCode extension project initialized with TypeScript and esbuild. Basic scripts set up. Extension compiles and activates.

   - ⬜ Not Started: No logic for creating/showing a `vscode.WebviewPanel` yet.

4. **Obtain Raw Git Diff Content (for a Changeset)**
   - ⬜ Not Started: No code to access Git extension or retrieve/log raw diff output.

5. **Execute External DiffGraph CLI Tool**
   - ⬜ Not Started: No integration with `diffgraph-cli` or dummy CLI script.

6. **Load Generated HTML into Webview**
   - ⬜ Not Started: No logic to load HTML output from CLI into a Webview.

## Summary
- **Current Progress:** Steps 1 and 2 of Phase 1 are complete (project setup, scripts, build system, and command registration).
